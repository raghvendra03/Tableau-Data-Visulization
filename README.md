## 1. Discount Mart

Discount Mart is basically a Supermarket and here I have created a Dashboard where we can track the company performance in terms of Sales, Profit and Quantity sold. I have also created Charts to know how well the categories are performing as well as the County/Regions.

You can also look for the Dashboard here [Discount Mart](https://public.tableau.com/profile/raghvendra.murnal#!/vizhome/DiscountMartSalesAnalytics_16031104306140/Dashboard1)

## 2. TESLA Stocks

Tesla is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company. Here I have created dashboard to see trends of the stock price for the last 3 months, I have also created this in such a way so that the charts will be updated daily. With daily closing figures and volume of stock traded.

I have created our own dataset with the help of Google Sheets and connected it with Tableau and created a Dashboard.
